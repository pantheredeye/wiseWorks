// An effective admin dashboard page for WiseWorks should provide administrators with a comprehensive overview of the platform's activity and allow them to manage users and monitor the system. It should include elements that facilitate user verification, activity monitoring, and support functions. Here are some elements that an effective admin dashboard page could include:

// 1. User Verification: Display a list of users who need to be verified, including their names, occupations, and verification status. This allows administrators to ensure the security and integrity of the platform.

// 2. Activity Monitoring: Provide a section that shows real-time activity on the platform, such as new user registrations, project creations, and review submissions. This helps administrators identify any fraudulent or malicious behavior.

// 3. User Management: Include functionality to manage user accounts, such as the ability to suspend or delete user accounts, update user information, and view user activity history.

// 4. Support and Help: Provide a section with contact information for the support team and links to FAQs or knowledge base resources. This allows administrators to assist users and address any issues or questions they may have.

// 5. System Monitoring: Display system health and performance metrics, such as server status, database usage, and any potential errors or warnings. This helps administrators ensure the smooth operation of the platform.

// In terms of visual layout, an effective admin dashboard page should be clean, organized, and easy to navigate. Here's a sample React code snippet to help lay out the organization of the admin dashboard page:

// This is a basic structure to illustrate the layout of the admin dashboard page using React. You can customize the design and styling according to your specific needs and UI framework. Additionally, you may want to handle edge cases, such as when there are no users to be verified or when there is no activity data to display.
