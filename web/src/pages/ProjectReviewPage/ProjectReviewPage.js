// An effective project review page for WiseWorks should provide retired engineers with a clear and organized interface to review the project plans and provide feedback. It should include relevant project information, documents, and a feedback form. Here are some elements that an effective project review page could include:

// 1. Project Title: Display the title of the project to provide a clear identification.

// 2. Project Description: Provide a detailed description of the project, including its goals, requirements, and any specific information that retired engineers should know.

// 3. Project Documents: Display any relevant documents or files attached to the project, such as PDFs, images, or other file formats. This allows retired engineers to access and review the necessary materials.

// 4. Feedback Form: Provide a form where retired engineers can provide feedback and recommendations on the project plans. This can include fields for general comments, specific suggestions, and any other relevant information.

// 5. Submit Button: A button that the retired engineer can click to submit their feedback for the project.

// In terms of visual layout, it's important to present the project review page in a clean and organized manner. Here's a sample React code snippet to help lay out the organization of the project review page:


// This is a basic structure to illustrate the layout of the project review page using React. You can customize the design and styling according to your specific needs and UI framework. Additionally, you may want to handle edge cases, such as when there are no project documents or when the feedback form is not filled out correctly.
