// An effective rating and feedback page for WiseWorks should provide practicing engineers with a platform to rate the performance of retired engineers and provide feedback. It should include elements that allow for a comprehensive evaluation and constructive feedback. Here are some elements that an effective rating and feedback page could include:

// 1. Retired Engineer Information: Display the name and relevant information of the retired engineer being reviewed. This helps to identify the specific individual being rated.

// 2. Rating System: Provide a rating system that allows practicing engineers to rate the performance of the retired engineer. This can be done using a numerical scale, star ratings, or any other appropriate rating system.

// 3. Feedback Form: Include a form where practicing engineers can provide detailed feedback and comments on the retired engineer's performance. This can include areas of strength, areas for improvement, and any specific recommendations or suggestions.

// 4. Project Details: Display relevant project details, such as the project title, description, and timeline. This helps provide context for the review and allows practicing engineers to refer to specific project experiences.

// 5. Submit Button: A button that the practicing engineer can click to submit their rating and feedback.

// In terms of visual layout, it's important to present the rating and feedback page in a clean and organized manner. Here's a sample React code snippet to help lay out the organization of the rating and feedback page:

// This is a basic structure to illustrate the layout of the rating and feedback page using React. You can customize the design and styling according to your specific needs and UI framework. Additionally, you may want to handle edge cases, such as when the rating is not provided or when the feedback form is not filled out correctly.
