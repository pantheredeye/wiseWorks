Here are some suggestions for next steps to further develop the WiseWorks application based on the information provided:

1. Build out the page layouts and components:

- Start with the main layout and create the header, footer, and any shared components like navigation, notifications, etc.

- Build the user and project layouts which will contain shared elements for those sections of the app.

- Construct reusable components like buttons, forms, modals that can be used across pages.

2. Implement core pages and functionality:

- Build the key pages outlined like the landing page, login/registration, project creation and project details.

- Set up routing and connections between pages.

- Add form functionality to capture user input.

- Implement back-end API calls to save and retrieve data.

3. Expand on MVP features:

- Create the reviewer dashboard, project review and rating pages.

- Build in file upload capabilities for project documents.

- Implement search and filtering for projects.

- Add user profiles, verification process, and other core features.

4. Add polish and refine UI/UX:

- Improve visual design, branding and styling.

- Optimize page layouts and information architecture based on user testing.

- Enhance accessibility and responsive design.

5. Set up testing and deployment:

- Implement unit, integration and end-to-end testing.

- Set up CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment.

- Deploy MVP to staging/production environment.

The key is to start with the core framework and build up from there in iterations, validating features and functionality along the way. Focus on developing the essential user flows first before expanding to secondary features.
