# WiseWorks
WiseWorks is a two-way marketplace for practicing engineers to post jobs for retired engineers to review them. Our platform is designed to connect these two groups in a secure and efficient way, so that practicing engineers can get the feedback they need on their project plans, while retired engineers can use their expertise and experience to make a difference in their field.

## How it Works
On WiseWorks, practicing engineers can post project plans, including relevant documents and other information, and set a budget for the project review. Retired engineers can browse available projects and apply to review them, based on their expertise and experience. Once a review has been accepted, the retired engineer will have access to the project plans and any related documents, and can provide feedback and recommendations to the practicing engineer. The practicing engineer can then rate the retired engineer's performance, creating a feedback loop that ensures the quality of the reviews and helps build a strong community of retired engineers.

## Key Features
* Secure authentication system to protect user data and ensure access control.
* Verification of professional engineering license before being able to post or review jobs, to ensure the quality of work and maintain the ethical standards required by their engineering ethics committee.
* A two-sided marketplace that connects practicing engineers and retired engineers, allowing practicing engineers to post jobs and retired engineers to review them.
* The ability for job posters to upload PDF files for review, and for reviewers to accept jobs and download PDFs.
* A rating system for both job posters and reviewers to provide feedback and establish trust in the community.


## Future Plans
In the future, we plan to expand WiseWorks to include additional features and functionalities, including:

* Advanced search and filtering options, to help retired engineers find projects that match their expertise and interests.
* Collaboration tools that allow practicing and retired engineers to work together on projects and share knowledge and resources.
* Analytics and reporting tools, to help users track their progress and measure the impact of their work on the platform.
* Additional payment options, including the ability to use cryptocurrencies or other alternative payment methods.
* An integrated chat system to facilitate project and community-wide communication.
